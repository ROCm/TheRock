# hipDNN Integration Test Configuration
#
# This TOML file is the single source of truth for plugin-agnostic integration
# test configuration.
#
# This config is read by the Python test runner (test_hipdnn_integration_tests.py)
# converted to JSON and passes it to the C++ harness via
# HIPDNN_TEST_CONFIG_PATH.
#
# This file lists ALL available plugins. A given build may only include a
# subset. At test time, the runner filters plugins down to those that were
# actually built using the enabled_plugins_manifest.json generated by CMake
# (see ml-libs/CMakeLists.txt). This ensures:
#   - Tests only run for plugins that are physically present
#   - Missing plugins are detected (the harness verifies expected plugins load)
#
# Schema:
#   [plugins.<name>]     - Plugin definition (path to .so, engine names)
#   [engines.<name>]     - Per-engine config (tolerance mode, expected failures)
#
# Example:
#   [plugins.example]
#   path = "libexample_plugin.so"
#   engines = ["EXAMPLE_ENGINE"]
#
#   [engines.EXAMPLE_ENGINE]
#   tolerance = "gh145_tolerance_issue_workaround"
#   expected_failures = [
#       "Smoke/IntegrationGpuConvFwd2dFp32.Correctness/EXAMPLE_ENGINE_NCHW_x1x32x8x8",
#   ]

[plugins.miopen]
path = "libmiopen_legacy_plugin.so"
engines = ["MIOPEN_PLUGIN"]
