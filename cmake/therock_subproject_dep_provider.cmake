# This is injected into sub-projects that contain dependencies. It runs in a

#   THEROCK_PROVIDED_PACKAGES: Package names that are to be provided from the
#     super-project
#   THEROCK_PACKAGE_DIR_${package_name}: Directory in the super-project to
#     resolve the dependency.
#   THEROCK_IGNORE_PACKAGES: Packages to ignore, even if they are in
#     THEROCK_PROVIDED_PACKAGES, falling back to the system resolver.
# See: _therock_cmake_subproject_setup_deps which assembles these variables

    # It is quite hard to completely neuter find_package so that for an

    # This is important because it "latches" and if any find_package manages
    # to escape to the system, it will likely find a library from outside the
    # super-project, which can cause all kinds of hard to diagnose issues.
    # For background, read carefully:
    # https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html#config-mode-search-procedure
    # We opt-to rewrite the signature, removing any options that connote an
    # implicit search behavior and then rewrite the signature to be explicit.
    # We further do this in a function to avoid macro namespace pollution, since
