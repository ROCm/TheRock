# Git Maintenance Chores

This is a running log of various chores that may need to be carried out to
manage the project sources and upstream connections.

## Rebase Sub-Projects (happy path)

If there are no problematic local patches that conflict with upstream projects,
then this command is sufficient to fast-forward all submodules to upstream
heads:

```
./build_tools/fetch_sources.py --remote --no-apply-patches
# Capture new submodule heads, inspect and ensure things look sound.
git add -A
git commit -m "Rebase submodules (for conflict prep)"
```

In the above, it is important to capture the submodule heads in a pristine
state, prior to any patches being applied. We'll squash all of the commits to
land.

Apply patches and validate:

```
./build_tools/fetch_sources.py
```

If that succeeds, create a PR and make sure that the CI passes.

### Resolving Conflicts

If the above fails, it will most likely be when applying patches and you will
get a message indicating that the `git am` command failed and left some state
in a submodule. When this happens, you should clean up by going into the
submodule, looking around and aborting the command. Then proceed to the
next section for rebasing with conflicts:

```
git am --abort
```

You can return the source tree to a consistent state by running (without
arguments):

```
./build_tools/fetch_sources.py --no-apply-patches
```

You will then want to iterate on any failing `git am` command, most likely
simply deleting patch files that are no longer needed (have been subsumed by
an upstream patch). Once your `patches/` directory is clean for the new heads,
do a final `./build_tools/fetch_sources.py`, add all files in a commit and
create a PR.

If modifying patches for a sub-project, you will need to resave its patch
stream. This can be done with a command like:

```
./build_tools/save_patches.sh origin/master Tensile amd-mainline
```

The first argument is the sub-project ToT commit, prior to any local patches.
The second is the submodule name (not path). The third is the sub-directory
within `patches/` that contains the project patches. The first argument is
project specific, unfortunately and can be found by looking at `git log` for
the base branch/tag (for using a symbolic tag).

The base ref can also be obtained by looking at `git submodule status`, assuming
that a commit has been made for the submodule in a pristine state. Example:

```
 b91661c88a0fd7f5848a60212839bfc2496ff932 math-libs/BLAS/Tensile (v2.2.3-4910-gb91661c8)
```

In this case, the commit `b91661c88a0fd7f5848a60212839bfc2496ff932` should be
the base ref. It is best to look at `git log` to verify, as it is quite
easy to get into an inconsistent state, and it is hard to spot errors in
commit hashes.
