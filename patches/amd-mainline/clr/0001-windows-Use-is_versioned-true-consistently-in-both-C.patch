Subject: [PATCH 1/2] [windows] Use is_versioned = true consistently in both
 Comgr::LoadLib paths.

Prior to this, RTCProgram was using is_version = true and device initialization was using false. On Windows, this was causing us to attempt to load amd_comgr_3.dll at device load and amd_comgr0605.dll for RTC programs. Obviously, there is only one DLL and it must be used consistently.
