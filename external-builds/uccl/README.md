## Build instructions

Upstream UCCL has a "rocm" build target for system-wide ROCm
installations that currently builds in an Ubuntu 22.04 docker
container.

We have contributed and upstreamed a new build target "therock" for
python packaged ROCm from TheRock. This setup uses that build
target. It is adapted to run in TheRock's PyPA-based docker container
to maximize compabitility.

### Prerequisites and setup

The build script currently requires that TheRock index URL be provided
explicitly and uses that to install python packaged ROCm along with
UCCL prerequisites inside the UCCL build container.

The specific versions of the ROCm python packages are recorded in the
UCCL wheel's dependences, along with compatible pytorch and numpy
python packages needed for UCCL collective and transfer engine
modules.

### Quickstart

Building is a two-step process. First, checkout upstream UCCL sources
to a local directory using the `uccl_repo.py` script. Then execute a
build script to prepare a build container and produce the UCCL wheel
artifact. Note that you need provide an index URL for the python
packaged ROCm matching your GPU's gfx arch.

Example:

```bash
python uccl_repo.py checkout
python build_prod_wheels.py --output-dir outputs \
  --python-version 3.12 \
  --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx94X-dcgpu
```

The build script has optional arguments for the name of the directory
with previously checked out UCCL sources (default `uccl`), to target a
specific python version, or to use a specific base image for the UCCL
build container.

The resulting wheel can then be installed like so:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx94X-dcgpu \
  uccl-0.0.1.post4-py3-none-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl[rocm]
```
