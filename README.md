TheRock (The HIP Environment and ROCm Kit) is a lightweight open source build platform for HIP and ROCm. The project is currently in an **early preview state** but is under active development and welcomes contributors. Come try us out! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

## Features

TheRock includes:

- A CMake super-project for HIP and ROCm source builds
- Tools for developing individual ROCm components
- Support for building PyTorch with ROCm from source
  - [JAX support](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/247) and other external project builds are in the works!
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and releasing supported components

## Building from source

We keep the following instructions for recent, commonly used operating system versions. Most build failures are due to minor operating system differences in dependencies and project setup. Refer to the [Environment Setup Guide](docs/environment_setup_guide.md) for contributed instructions and configurations for alternatives.

### Setup - Ubuntu (24.04)

```bash
# Install Ubuntu dependencies
sudo apt install gfortran git git-lfs ninja-build cmake g++ pkg-config xxd patchelf automake python3-venv python3-dev libegl1-mesa-dev

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock.git
cd TheRock

# Init python virtual environment and install python dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download submodules and apply patches
python ./build_tools/fetch_sources.py
```

### Setup - Windows 11 (VS 2022)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See [windows_support.md](./docs/development/windows_support.md) for setup
> instructions on Windows, in particular
> the section for
> [installing tools](./docs/development/windows_support.md#install-tools).

```bash
# Install dependencies following the Windows support guide

# Clone interop library from https://github.com/nod-ai/amdgpu-windows-interop
# for CLR (the "HIP runtime") on Windows. The path used can also be configured
# using the `THEROCK_AMDGPU_WINDOWS_INTEROP_DIR` CMake variable.
git clone https://github.com/nod-ai/amdgpu-windows-interop.git

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock.git
cd TheRock

# Init python virtual environment and install python dependencies
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download submodules and apply patches
python ./build_tools/fetch_sources.py
```

### Build configuration

The build can be customized through cmake feature flags.

#### Required configuration flags

- `-DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=`

  or

- `-DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_TARGETS=`

> [!NOTE]
> Not all family and targets are currently supported.
> See [therock_amdgpu_targets.cmake](cmake/therock_amdgpu_targets.cmake) file
> for available options.

#### Optional configuration flags

By default, the project builds everything available. The following group flags
enable/disable selected subsets:

| Group flag                       | Description                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_ALL=OFF`       | Disables all optional components     |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_CORE=OFF`      | Disables all core components         |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_COMM_LIBS=OFF` | Disables all communication libraries |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_MATH_LIBS=OFF` | Disables all math libraries          |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_ML_LIBS=OFF`   | Disables all ML libraries            |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_PROFILER=OFF`  | Disables profilers                   |

Individual features can be controlled separately (typically in combination with
`-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_ALL=OFF` or `-DTHEROCK_RESET_FEATURES=ON` to force a
minimal build):

| Component flag                     | Description                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_COMPILER=ON`     | Enables the GPU+host compiler toolchain       |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_HIPIFY=ON`       | Enables the hipify tool                       |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_CORE_RUNTIME=ON` | Enables the core runtime components and tools |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_HIP_RUNTIME=ON`  | Enables the HIP runtime components            |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_ROCPROFV3=ON`    | Enables rocprofv3                             |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_RCCL=ON`         | Enables RCCL                                  |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_PRIM=ON`         | Enables the PRIM library                      |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_BLAS=ON`         | Enables the BLAS libraries                    |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_RAND=ON`         | Enables the RAND libraries                    |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_SOLVER=ON`       | Enables the SOLVER libraries                  |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_SPARSE=ON`       | Enables the SPARSE libraries                  |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_MIOPEN=ON`       | Enables MIOpen                                |

> [!TIP]
> Enabling any features will implicitly enable their *minimum* dependencies. Some
> libraries (like MIOpen) have a number of *optional* dependencies, which must
> be enabled manually if enabling/disabling individual features.

> [!TIP]
> A report of enabled/disabled features and flags will be printed on every
> CMake configure.

### CMake build usage

To build ROCm/HIP:

```bash
cmake -B build -GNinja . -DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=gfx110X-dgpu
cmake --build build
```

To build with the [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) compiler cache:

```bash
cmake -B build -GNinja -DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=gfx110X-dgpu \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache \
  .

cmake --build build
```

### Running tests

Project-wide testing can be controlled with the standard CMake `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON|OFF` flag. This gates both setup of build tests and compilation of installed testing artifacts.

Tests of the integrity of the build are enabled by default and can be run
with ctest:

```
ctest --test-dir build
```

Testing functionality on an actual GPU is in progress and will be documented
separately.
